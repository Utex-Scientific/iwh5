IWH5 is a data format developed for Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) workflows, using HDF5 as its foundation. It provides a structured way to bundle inspection data into a single file that remains portable and easy to interpret. Its layout supports clear grouping of related content, making it suitable for use cases that involve dense scan data. IWH5 simplifies working with complex datasets by keeping both raw data and context information together, supporting long-term access and compatibility across different analysis tools.
