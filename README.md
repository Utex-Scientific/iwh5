# Welcome to IWH5 - Based on Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) for NDE

IWH5 is a specialized implementation of the HDF5 format tailored for data files, especially in Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). It efficiently organizes complex inspection data, enabling seamless integration, storage, and retrieval of scan and measurement information.

In Non-Destructive Evaluation, managing complex and large datasets—from ultrasonic scans to phased array data—is crucial for accurate inspection and analysis. Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) offers a robust and flexible solution designed to handle such demanding data requirements.

HDF enables efficient storage of multidimensional arrays, images, and metadata in a single, portable file, organized in a clear hierarchical structure. This makes it ideal for NDE applications where detailed scan data, calibration parameters, and inspection results need to be stored together and accessed quickly.

By adopting HDF, NDE professionals can improve data integrity, enhance interoperability across tools and systems, and streamline the processing of inspection datasets—empowering better defect detection and quality assurance.
